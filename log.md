# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 29, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I was thinking to start with Data Analysis with Python on FreeCodeCamp. Then, thought of giving a headsup to the beginner version in coding. Thereby i reached Responsive Web Design Certification Project. It took me to Learn HTML by building a Cat Photo App which is entirely different from the area I have chosen for doing the project. But was interesting and I have reached 45th step. 

**Thoughts**: It gave me immense pleasure to complete 44 steps in one go and looking forward to finish it soon.
